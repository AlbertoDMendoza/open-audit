$intro = 'When a discovery is run, the relevant discovery scan option is chosen and those settings are used by Nmap to scan the target devices.  The scan options determine which ports nmap scans, how fast they scan and whether or not nmap ping is first used to determine if the IP is live or not.<br>
<br>
Starting with Open-AudIT 2.3.2 we have introduced sets of pre-configured options for running the discovery scan, these pre-configured options allow a range of Nmap scan options. More detail is here: New Discovery Options<br>
<br>
As at 3.3.0 we have introduced a "filtered|open" option to discovery scan options, this option determines if an open but filtered port is considered as an interesting port on the remote device. It has a default of "y". Previously we used the "filtered" column to check for open|filtered. This change aligns the discovery scan options with Nmap return strings.<br>
<br>
As at 4.0.3 we allow the user to over-write individual discovery scan options without having to create a "custom scan".<br>
<br>
<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
<br>
When a discovery is run, the relevant discovery scan option is chosen and those settings used by Nmap to scan the target devices. If no option set is chosen, the default configuration item (discovery_default_scan_option) is selected and used.<br>
Open-AudIT Community will use the default options as per the configuration for all discoveries.<br>
<br>
Open-AudIT Professional has the ability to choose from a pre-defined list of discovery scan options, per discovery.<br>
<br>
Open-AudIT Enterprise has the ability to choose from a pre-defined list of discovery scan options and also to customise individual options per discovery.<br>
<br>
The default discovery scan option is the UltraFast set.<br>
<br>
<br>
If a device is individually discovered using the "Discover Device" link on the device details page, we first check if this device has been discovered previously (by Discovery) and if so, use the discovery options from that scan. If it has not been previously discovered, we revert to the configuration item discovery_default_scan_option the settings.<br><br>';

<h2>Creating a Discovery Scan Options entry</h2>
<br>
<p>Discovery Scan Options are just another item collection. Enterprise users can create, read, update and delete entries as required. Professional users can read all entries, but not create new entries, update existing entries or delete entries. Community users have no GUI that allows access to this collection.</p>
<br>
<p>The attributes for discovery scan options are as below.</p>

                <p>This has caused some customers issues where firewalls respond on behalf of a non-existing device, and hence cause false positive device detection. We now have this attribute available to set per scan.</p>
