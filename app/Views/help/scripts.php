$intro = '<p>You can create a script with all the options for any of the existing audit scripts - not just Windows. AIX, ESX, Linux, OSX and Windows are all covered.</p>
<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
    <p>We initially setup the default list of scripts with the default options. The list of script is viewable at /scripts. These default scripts cannot be deleted. You can create additional scripts for use by you as required. Your script will be based on one of the existing scripts and have custom options applied. The scripts can then be downloaded from the list page at menu: Discover -> Audit Scripts -> List Audit Scripts.</p><br>';

$body = '<h2>Modifying an Existing Script</h2>
    <p>You are always free to modify the audit scripts themselves to suit your specific requirements. You will need to (re)incorporate those changes whenever you upgrade as they will be overwritten by the default scripts. I would suggest saving a master copy of your modified script, upgrading Open-AudIT, then running a diff between the new default script and your modified script and applying the differences. The audit scripts are native scripts (Windows is VBScript, all others are Bash). Simple and easy to modify - just make sure to have a copy of your changes before you upgrade.</p>

    <h2>Debugging a Script</h2>
    <p>So a script isn\'t working on a recalcitrant device. Grrr. The scripts for Windows, Linux, and MacOS all accept the debugging argument. This can be set in the script itself, or provided on the command line. Run the script using that option set to 5 and you should see in which section of the script the failure occurs. For example -</p>
<pre>./audit_linux.sh debugging=5 submit_online=n create_file=y</pre>
Or<br>
<pre>cscript audit_windows.vbs debugging=5 submit_online=n create_file=y</pre>
<br>';
