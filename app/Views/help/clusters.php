$intro = '<p>With the 3.3.0 release of Open-AudIT we have introduced the concept of a Cluster. This intuitively maps to the idea of a web cluster, database cluster or file cluster (or one of several other purposes) into a given type (high availability, redundancy, scaling, etc).<br>
    <br>
    Depending on the purpose of cluster chosen, the reporting will be slightly different.<br>
    <br>
    For example, if you create a Cluster with a purpose of virtualisation, when you have added devices to it you will also see the virtual machines on those devices.<br>
