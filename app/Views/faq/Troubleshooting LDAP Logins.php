$intro = '<p><h3>Using LDAPS</h3>
<p>By default, we skip certificate validation because customers tend to use self-signed certificates. To enable certificate validation, edit the file below:<br>
<br>
<strong>Linux</strong><br>
<code>/usr/local/open-audit/app/Models/logonModel.php</code><br>
<br>
<strong>Windows</strong><br>
<code>c:\xampp\open-audit\app\Models\logonModel.php</code><br>
<br>
Comment out the below line (about line 49 or so). Just place a hash # at the start of the line.<br>
<code>putenv(\'LDAPTLS_REQCERT=never\');</code><br>
<br>
Once commented out, your certificate will be validated, but may also fail this validation if you\'re using self-signed certificates and haven\'t configured your server correctly.<br>
<br>
More information about debugging this can be found on a helpful Stack Overflow thread - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25424622/authenticating-a-self-signed-certificate-for-ldaps-connection">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25424622/authenticating-a-self-signed-certificate-for-ldaps-connection</a>.<br>
<br>
One other item to be careful of - make sure you use the hostname (or fqdn) of your LDAP Server that matches what is in the certificate (not just the LDAP Servers IP address) when creating the LDAP entry in Open-AudIT.<br>
<br></p>

<h2>First</h2>
<p>Let\'s set the logging to debug. Copy the file:<br>
<strong>Linux</strong><br>
<code>/usr/local/open-audit/env</code><br>
<strong>Windows</strong><br>
<code>c:\xampp\open-audit\env</code><br>
<br>
To a new file named .env (in the same directory). Now edit that new file and uncomment (remove the #) the line below (line 17):<br>
<code># CI_ENVIRONMENT = development</code><br>
This should be commented out after troubleshooting as debug mode will generate a lot of logs on the disk for no benefit.<br><br>
</p>

<h2>Second</h2>
<p>Try logging in using an LDAP user. We are assuming this will fail (otherwise, why are you still reading this?). Next, comment out the line from ther file above.<br><br></p>

<h2>Third</h2>
<p>Read through the log file at open-audit\writable\logs\log-$year-$day.log and the final lines will likely be of most interest. These lines should give you the exact point at which the login failed.<br><br></p>
