You know this particular server is configured just the way you want it but you\'re unsure if other servers in the cluster are configured exactly the same.

Each test is for a specific item. An example would be testing for SSH version 1.2.3.<br /><br /><strong>Details</strong> - Baselines can compare netstat ports, users and software.<br /><br /><strong>Software</strong> - To compare software we check the name and version. Because version numbers are not all standardised in format, when we receive an audit result we create a new attribute called software_padded which we store in the database along with the rest of the software details for each package. For this reason, baselines using software policies will not work when run against a device that has not been audited by 1.10 (at least). Software policies can test against the version being "equal to", "greater than" or "equal to or greater than".<br /><br /><strong>Netstat Ports</strong> - Netstat Ports use a combination of port number, protocol and program. If all are present the policy passes.<br /><br /><strong>Users</strong> - Users work similar to Netstat Ports. If a user exists with a matching name, status and password details (changeable, expires, required) then the policy passes.<br /><br /></p>';
